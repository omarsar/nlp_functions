# Concepts-Crawler
A set of functions that are useful when dealing with Natural Language Processing (NLP) Projects. It also includes some rules that are used to extract some concepts from pieces of text.

This crawler could be used in many ways. I used it for my keyword extraction research. 

For instance, if I wanted to extract the concept or keyword or even subject / object of the text below:

"I really like the cover of GQ Magazine"

The extractor is able to extract "GQ Magazine" as the concept in this piece of text. 

In the code you will find a bunch of rules to extract concepts based on the following research publication:
